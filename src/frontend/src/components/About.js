                    Dabbler is a website that ranks the top 10 breweries in Minnesota. A variety of factors determine what makes a brewery great. Our ranking uses a combination of drinks offered, location, and top selling drink to determine a brewery’s position on the coveted top 10 list. As we continue to develop features for the website, we look forward to offering new and unique engagement options for getting involved in Minnesota’s local brewing scene.
