# dabbler

Project Description:

Website that provides brewery rankings. We aim to solve the central problem of the saturated microbrew market in Minnesota, in the United States. With so many options, it is difficult to select a beer one will like from a brewery let alone remember past selections.

While there are existing services such as Untappd, they tend to focus on the mobile market and are less web oriented. This aims to fill that market gap.

This project is small-scale and highly localized, but may scale up if users become engaged with the website.

Happy dabbling!
